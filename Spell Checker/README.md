# Simple Spell Checker (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly Python program that checks the spelling of words in a sentence and suggests corrections.  
It uses the [`pyspellchecker`](https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/) library.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects misspelled words.
- Suggests and replaces them with the most likely correct spelling.
- Works for simple sentences.
- Easy to understand code for beginners.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the `pyspellchecker` library:

```bash
pip install pyspellchecker
```
ðŸš€ How to Run

    Save the Python code in a file, for example spell_checker.py.

    Open a terminal in the same directory.

    Run the program:

```bash
python spell_checker.py
```

ðŸ’» Example Usage

Enter text to check (or 'q' to quit): Ths is a smple progrm

Correcting "Ths" to "This"
Correcting "smple" to "simple"
Correcting "progrm" to "program"
Original text: Ths is a smple progrm
Corrected text: This is a simple program

ðŸ“œ How It Works

    The program splits the entered text into words.

    It checks each word against the dictionary in pyspellchecker.

    If a word is misspelled, it replaces it with the most likely correct spelling.

    It displays both the original and corrected text.

ðŸ›  Future Improvements

    Handle punctuation properly.

    Add grammar checking.

    Suggest multiple possible corrections.

ðŸ“„ License

This project is free to use and modify for learning purposes.

If you want, I can also make a **version with punctuation handling** and update this README so it shows more polished examples. That way it works more like a real spell checker.
